% GUI -- What next?


# User interfaces

How does the user interact with your code?

- Command line interface (CLI)
- Graphical user interface (GUI)

There are many more fine-grained definitions and notions!


# Command line interfaces

- Issue command after command
- Mostly used inside the terminal
- Examples: Shell, Python, Text adventures, ...


# Graphical user interfaces

- Event driven
- Render windows, buttons, etc.
- Examples: spyder, webbrowsers, office programs...


# Event driven

\begin{tikzpicture}[->,node distance = 4cm, auto, thick]
    \tikzstyle{every state}=[fill=blue!10,draw=black,rectangle]
    \node [state] (register) {register listeners};
    \node [state,right of=register] (eventcheck) {any events?};
    \node [state,right of=eventcheck] (notify) {notify listeners};
    \draw (register) edge (eventcheck)
            (eventcheck) edge [bend right] node {yes} (notify)
            (notify) edge [bend right] (eventcheck)
            (eventcheck)  edge [loop above]  node {no} (eventcheck);
\end{tikzpicture}


# Event types

What events do you think can happen?


# Event types

- Keyboard inputs/Mouse Inputs
- Opening, Closing, Minimizing, Maximizing
- Screen updates
- Calculation results
- ...

$\Rightarrow$ High complexity and flexibility needed!


# Don't reinvent the wheel

- Tkinter
- Qt
- native solutions

::: notes

There are many GUI frameworks. The most common one in Python is Tkinter.

Tkinter is just the Python "translation" of Tcl/Tk, which can be found here:

# Redraw

GUIs need to redraw changes, e.g. a button press:

![](img/button_normal.png){width=150}![](img/button_pressed.png){width=150}


# Redraw demo

\scriptsize

```{ .python file=code/button_only.py }
```

\normalsize

::: notes

`Tk()` creates the window (the "root" element), `mainloop` runs the event loop
and handles events.

Since it runs indefinitely, it also keeps the program from closing!

The Button can close the program (`quit` on the root element).

:::


# Redraw: A tree approach

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[->,node distance=2cm, auto, thick]
        \node [rectangle, draw=black] (root) {root};
        \node [rectangle, draw=black, below left of=root] (f1) {frame};
        \node [rectangle, draw=black, below right of=root] (f2) {frame};
        \node [rectangle, draw=black, below of=f1] (b1) {button};
        \node [rectangle, draw=black, below left of=f2] (b2) {button};
        \node [rectangle, draw=black, below right of=f2] (lbl) {label};
        \draw (root) edge (f1)
            (root) edge (f2)
            (f1) edge (b1)
            (f2) edge (b2)
            (f2) edge (lbl);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

- Each element has a parent (except root).
- Each element knows its children.

Why is this useful?

::: notes

Using a tree is useful because on updates of an element only that element and
its children need to be redrawn.

:::


# The tree GUI

\tiny

```{ .python file=code/tree_example.py }
```

\normalsize

::: notes

The elements (or "Widgets") used here are:

- Button: A button to click
- Label: Contains descriptions text
- Frame: Groups together different elements

:::


# Buttons and event callbacks

```{ .python }
def print_action():
    print('Hello World')

tk.Button(root, text="Print!", command=print_action)
```


::: notes

Buttons take a callback function.

Whenever you click a button, the function is executed.

:::


# Labels

```{ .python }
tk.Label(root, text='This is static label text')
```


# Changing label texts

\tiny

```{ .python file=code/update_label.py }
```

\normalsize

::: notes

`tk.StringVar` (and others: `IntVar`, `DoubleVar`) wrap Python data into
a format Tcl/Tk can understand. They allow to update components if you change
their values.

Note that you need to change the argument name from `text` for the static
solution to `textvariable`.

:::


# Organizing interface components: Layout management

Noticed the `pack` call everywhere?

```{ .python }
label = tk.Label(root, text='Some label')
label.pack()
```

It registers the widget with the *geometry manager*

::: notes

http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/layout-mgt.html

The geometry manager determines where layout components need to be placed. You
just need to tell it what to include (and in which relations) and it will do
all the pixel level math for you.

:::


# Layout management

More common than the `pack()` method is `grid()`:

```{ .python }
label = tk.Label(root, text='Some label in the second row')
label.grid(row=1, column=0, columspan=3)
```


# Layout management example

\tiny

```{ .python file=code/grid_example.py }
```

# Combing everything we learned

In the accompanying zip there is an example project, `iris_viz`.

It contains a lot of things we discussed during the lecture:

- File I/O: It downloads the iris data set if it's not available
- Plotting: It allows to plot iris data
- GUIs
- Error handling and documentation

Some examples are on the next slides, but we will skip those as I'll show it in
the code.


# File I/O

```{ .python }
try:
    with open('iris.data', 'r') as iris_file:
        data = iris_file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
    data = requests.get(url).text
    with open('iris.data', 'w') as iris_file:
        iris_file.write(data)
```


# Plotting

\scriptsize

```{ .python }
def update_plot(self):
    axes = self.figure.gca()
    axes.clear()
    axes.set_title('Iris data')

    x = self._x_selection.get()
    y = self._y_selection.get()
    axes.set_xlabel(self.labels[x] + ' in cm')
    axes.set_ylabel(self.labels[y] + ' in cm')

    for cl, col in zip(list(set(d[4] for d in self.data)),
                        ['orange', 'green', 'blue']):
        axes.scatter(*zip(*((d[x], d[y]) for d in self.data if d[4] == cl)),
                        color=col, label=cl)

    axes.legend()
```

\normalsize


# GUI

\scriptsize

```{ .python }
for row, label in enumerate(self.labels[:-1]):
    radio = tk.Radiobutton(self.frame_x, variable=self._x_selection,
                            value=row, text=label,
                            command=self.update_plot)
    radio.grid(row=row, column=1, sticky=tk.W)
```


# Error handling

```{ .python }
def maybe_float(v):
    try:
        return float(v)
    except ValueError:
        return v
```

# Challenges to improve your skills

https://github.com/karan/Projects
  ~ Small functions up to medium sized projects: Fibonacci sequence to RSS readers

https://projecteuler.net/
  ~ Lots of math problems, e.g. find the sum of the first 1000 prime numbers

http://natureofcode.com/book/
  ~ An introduction to more scientific programming (math, simulations, ...) than this class


# My advice

- If you just need Python for some data analyses, install numpy and get started!
- If you enjoyed the class, try to join "Scientific Programming in Python" the next time it's offered.
- If you want to dive deeper into programming, learn other programming
  languages. Java, C++, Prolog, Haskell, Lisp, there are many many many more.

- Join next week's lecture in 93/E42 to see all awesome projects!

::: notes

For numpy, definitely checkout these awesome articles:

- https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.12.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html
- https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/EricsBroadcastingDoc

You don't need to master other programming languages, but it helps to get away
from "Syntax" and start thinking about "Semantics" of code, you will become
better at generalizing ideas and concepts instead of focusing on a particular
parenthesis or bracket.
